Animated Lovelace card for bin collection days: the bin fills up over the cycle, shakes the evening before pickup, hops on pickup day and sparkles once emptied.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyrotter/ha-poubelle-card/main/images/en/preview.gif)

## ✨ Features

| State | When | Animation |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | other days | contents rise, the lid lifts |
| Full (≥ 60 %) | end of the cycle | flies 🪰 and smells, bags wobble |
| **Tonight** | the day before pickup | the bin shakes, red border |
| **Pickup** | pickup day, before the truck | the bin hops |
| **Emptied** | pickup day, after the truck | sparkles ✨, green border |

- 10 colours: `grey`, `black`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `brown`, `red`, `purple`, `burgundy`, `lime`
- **Fully coloured bin** (`full_color: true`) or coloured lid only
- **Rubbish bag** (`container: bag`) and **bulky waste** pile (`container: bulky`), or your own picture (`image`)
- Schedules: weekly, **every N weeks from a start date** (fortnightly, four-weekly…), even/odd weeks, once a month, seasonal months
- **Public holidays** from the [Holiday](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/holiday) integration, **next work day** from the [Workday](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/workday) integration
- Or read the date from an entity: date sensor, days-left sensor, `calendar`, [Waste Collection Schedule](https://github.com/mampfes/hacs_waste_collection_schedule)
- Card and visual editor follow your **Home Assistant language** automatically (English, French, Serbian Cyrillic and Latin; other languages fall back to English)
- No dependencies, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

## 📦 Installation

Requires **Home Assistant 2026.1** or later.

### HACS (recommended)
1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → add `https://github.com/skyrotter/ha-poubelle-card`, type **Dashboard**.
2. Search for **Poubelle Card** → Download.
3. Reload the browser (Ctrl + F5).

### Manual
1. Download `poubelle-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/skyrotter/ha-poubelle-card/releases/latest) and copy it to `/config/www/`.
2. Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources → add `/local/poubelle-card.js` (type *JavaScript module*).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything can be set from the visual editor. YAML examples:

### Weekly
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: red
name: General waste
days: [tuesday, friday]   # or [1, 4] (0 = Monday … 6 = Sunday)
hour: 6                   # time the truck comes
```

### Australian bins
Typical lids: `red` general waste, `yellow` recycling, `lime` garden or FOGO, `burgundy` food / FOGO, `purple` glass, `blue` paper. Councils differ, so pick the colour of your lid and set `content` for what goes in it.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: lime
name: FOGO
content: organics
start_date: 2026-11-04
every: 2
full_color: true
```

### Every N weeks from a start date (fortnightly recycling)
`start_date` is any date the bin was or will be collected. Pickups repeat every `every` weeks from it, forwards and backwards. The weekday comes from `start_date` unless you set `days`.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: yellow
start_date: 2026-11-04    # a known recycling Wednesday
every: 2                  # 1 = weekly, 2 = fortnightly, 4 = every four weeks
```
Recycling and garden waste on alternate weeks? Give the second card a start date one week later.

### Public holidays
Add the **Holiday** integration (Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Holiday) for your country and state. The card finds its calendar automatically, or you can pick it with `holiday_calendar`.

```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: red
days: [friday]
holidays: next_work_day
```

| `holidays` | A pickup that falls on a public holiday… | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `none` (default) | is unaffected | — |
| `next_day` | moves to the next calendar day | Holiday |
| `next_work_day` | moves to the next working day | Holiday + Workday |
| `shift_week` | moves to the same day the following week (again if that is also a holiday) | Holiday |
| `shift_rest_of_week` | it and the rest of that week's pickups move one day later | Holiday |
| `cancel` | doesn't happen | Holiday |

`next_work_day` uses the calendar of the **Workday** integration, so your weekends, excluded days and added/removed holidays are respected. Without it, the card skips holidays and Sundays and shows a warning.

When a pickup is moved the card says so: “Pickup on Tuesday · moved (public holiday)”. Extra one-off dates can be added with `holiday_dates: ["2026-12-24"]`.

### Fully coloured bin
By default only the lid is coloured. With `full_color` the whole bin is (the wheel stays black), which is easier to read with several bins side by side.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: blue
days: [tuesday]
full_color: true
```
![Fully coloured bins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyrotter/ha-poubelle-card/main/images/en/preview-full-color.png)

### Rubbish bag
A tied bag replaces the wheelie bin. It is flat at the start of the cycle and fills out until pickup day. The yellow bag is translucent, like recycling bags.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: yellow
container: bag
days: [thursday]
```
![Rubbish bags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyrotter/ha-poubelle-card/main/images/en/preview-sacs.png)

### Bulky waste
A pile of items (fridge, mattress, TV, tyre, box…) that grows until pickup day. `bin` is optional (grey meter by default).
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
container: bulky
month_week: 1        # first Wednesday of the month
days: [wednesday]
```

### Custom image
`image` replaces the drawing with your own picture (PNG or SVG, ideally on a transparent background), whatever the container.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
container: bulky
image: /local/bulky.png
days: [wednesday]
month_week: 1
```

### Seasonal pickups
`months` limits pickups to some months (numbers or names). Out of season the card shows the next pickup date.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: green
name: Garden waste
days: [friday]
months: [9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Even / odd weeks
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: yellow
days: [tuesday]
weeks: even        # ISO week numbers; the other bin: weeks: odd
```
For fortnightly pickups, `start_date` + `every: 2` is usually easier to match to your council calendar.

### Once a month
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: blue
days: [tuesday]
month_week: 1        # 1st Tuesday of the month (2, 3, 4 or last)
```
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: green
days: [saturday]
month_week: [2, 4]   # 2nd and 4th Saturdays
```
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: green
month_day: 15        # the 15th of every month
```

### From an entity
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: yellow
entity: sensor.recycling_pickup   # date, days left, calendar.*, Waste Collection Schedule…
interval: 14                      # days between pickups (for the fill level)
hour: 6
```

### From a calendar
One calendar for all bins? `calendar_filter` keeps only the events whose title contains this text (case-insensitive). The fill level then follows the real previous pickup, so `interval` isn't needed.
```yaml
type: custom:poubelle-card
bin: yellow
entity: calendar.bin_collections
calendar_filter: Recycling      # or a list: [Recycling, Paper]
hour: 6
```
Is the event the day before pickup (“Put the bins out”)? Add `calendar_offset: 1`.

### Two cards side by side (sections view)
```yaml
type: grid
columns: 2
square: false
cards:
  - type: custom:poubelle-card
    bin: red
    days: [1, 4]
    compact: true
    show_meter: false
    scale: 0.47
    headroom: 20
  - type: custom:poubelle-card
    bin: yellow
    start_date: 2026-11-04
    every: 2
    compact: true
    show_meter: false
    scale: 0.47
    headroom: 20
```

- **Waste Collection Schedule**: `daysTo` attribute
- `sensor` whose state is a **date** (`2026-10-20`), a **timestamp**, a **number of days** (`3`) or `today` / `tomorrow`
- `calendar.*`: events of the past and next 60 days, filterable by title (`calendar_filter`)
- `input_datetime` (with a date)

### Styling with card-mod / themes
CSS variables: `--poubelle-card-background`, `--poubelle-card-border-color`, `--poubelle-card-text-color`, `--poubelle-card-secondary-color`. State classes on `ha-card`: `veille` (tonight), `jour` (pickup), `videe` (emptied), `plein` (full).

## 🔄 Upgrading from 1.x

Existing dashboards keep working: the French values (`noire`, `sac`, `paires`, `report`, `annule`…) are still accepted, and the visual editor shows them as their English equivalents.

- **Home Assistant 2026.1 or later** is required.
- **Public holidays** now come from the Holiday integration instead of a built-in French list. If you use `holidays`, add the Holiday integration for your country (and region); `region` is no longer used.
- **`holidays: next_day` now means the next calendar day.** The old behaviour (next day that is not a holiday or a Sunday) is `next_work_day`; `report` and `shift` map to it.
- `decalage` is now called `shift_rest_of_week` (same behaviour). `shift_week` is new: the pickup moves a whole week.

## 🌍 Translations

Translations live in [`src/lang/`](src/lang), one JSON file per language, named with the Home Assistant language code (`de.json`, `pt-BR.json`…). To add one: copy `en.json`, translate the values (keep `{placeholders}`), register it in `src/localize.js` and open a pull request. Missing keys fall back to English; day and month names come from the browser automatically.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
npm install
npm test          # scheduling logic + translation files
npm run build     # src/ → dist/poubelle-card.js
npm run watch     # rebuild on change
npm run screenshots  # README images in images/<lang>/ (needs Chrome and ffmpeg)
```
Edit files in `src/`, never `dist/` directly; commit the rebuilt `dist/poubelle-card.js` with your change (CI checks it is up to date). Releases attach `dist/poubelle-card.js` automatically; the release tag must match the version in `package.json`.
